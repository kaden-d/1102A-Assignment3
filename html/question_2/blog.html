        <h2>Do Dogs Know Their Own Name?</h2>
        <div class="items">
            <p>
                Dogs seem to grasp the connection between their names and positive experiences primarily through repetition and association. 
                When they hear their names in situations like playtime or when receiving attention, they learn that responding to that specific sound brings positive outcomes. 
                While their understanding might not be the same as human comprehension, dogs associate the sound with a set of experiences. 
                It's worth noting that the responsiveness of individual dogs can vary based on factors like breed, training, and personality.

        <h2>Essential Tips To Raise Healthy Pets.</h2>
        <div class="items">
            <p>
                Keeping pets healthy is about giving them the right care. Make sure they eat well, exercise regularly, and visit the vet for check-ups and vaccinations. 
                Protect them from parasites, keep their water clean, and provide toys and grooming for stimulation. Create a safe space for them. 
                Consider spaying/neutering and positive training, tailoring care to your pet's needs. Keep an eye on changes in behavior or health and consult your vet as needed.

        <h2>Why Does My Dog Attack Me?</h2>
        <div class="items">
            <p>
                If your dog seems like it's attacking you, it's probably just playing rough. 
                Dogs express themselves with their mouths and may get a bit rowdy during playtime. 
                Look for signs like a wagging tail and relaxed body language to know it's all in good fun. 
                Just set clear limits and redirect their energy positively. If you're still unsure, consider getting advice from a dog trainer.

        <h2>How To Throw A Birthday For Your Dog.</h2>
        <div class="items">
            <p>
                Throwing a birthday party for your dog is fun! Make or buy dog-friendly treats like frozen coconut oil and peanut butter, 
                decorate with dog-themed stuff, and invite furry friends for a playdate. 
                Get new toys or a comfy bed as gifts. Plan activities your dog loves, like fetch or a dog park visit. 
                Take cute photos in a little booth, sing happy birthday, and give a small dog-friendly cake piece. 
                If your dog likes friends, invite them over and send them home with treats. After the fun, let your dog relax with cuddles or a nap. 
                Keep it simple and all about what your dog loves!
